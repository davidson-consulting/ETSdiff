# Contributing

Contributors are very welcome! **No contribution is too small and all contributions are valued.**

Some suggestions to get started:
* Lock at [issues](https://github.com/davidson-consulting/ETSdiff/issues) and use comments to enabled discussion
* propose your own issues/pull request to improve software and documentation

## Tests

As soon as possible write unitary tests to cover your modifications/enhancements

## Before requesting a review

* use `cargo test` to ensure that everythings is ok
* use `cargo clippy`to track some rules
* use `rust-analyzer` as linter
